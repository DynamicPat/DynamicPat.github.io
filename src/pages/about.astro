        Patrick Best is an Application Systems Manager at CarMax and a former Engineering Manager at Snagajob. He’s led teams across product delivery, incident response, and platform reliability, and still loves getting hands-on when it sharpens the outcome.

        He co-founded Weaver’s Circle as CTO to build products that strengthen social belonging. Earlier, he grew as a full-stack engineer at Tech Dynamism, combining business analysis, architecture, and shipping code.

      <h2>Values & principles</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Care over clever — defaults should feel wise.</li>
        <li>Clarity first — decide once, document well.</li>
        <li>Small wins — momentum from tiny, finished work.</li>
        <li>Texture matters — motion and type that help.</li>
        <li>Systems beat goals — habits make progress inevitable.</li>
      </ul>

        <li>Design through writing; name things well.</li>
        <li>Automate the boring; protect attention.</li>
